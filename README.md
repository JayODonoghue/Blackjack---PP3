# BLACKJACK

<br/>

This is your typical game of Blackjack using python backend programming to complete. The game is aimed at a natural flowing game flow returning as good user experience. Inputs are used throughout provide constant interaction with the user along with cues for any ease of use. The user (you) begins the game with 1000 coins. You then place your wager and draw card. The dealer (computer) gets dealt two cards also however one is hidden. You are then presented with the option to 'hit' or 'stand'. If hit is chosen the user draws another card and if not bust is goven the option  of 'hit' or 'stand' again. If stand is chosen then the dealers cards are shown. If the dealer is under 17 then they have to automatically hit. If they are between 17 and 21 then the dealer and user scores are compared. If either player goes bust, the other wins. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible. If you reach 21 Blackjack is declared. Otherwise the player with the highest total is the winner. If it is a draw its called a push. Once a winner/loser/draw is determined our winngs/losses will be adjusted accordingly.
